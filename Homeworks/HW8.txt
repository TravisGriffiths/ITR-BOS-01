Homework 8

1) Add in as many routes as you can for your Project application

2) Put in the corrisponding Controller methods and Views

3) For now just hard code any instance variables (@instance_variable) needed

4) Insert your CSS into application.css OR build out layouts and alternative
CSS as needed. 

5) Build out views as possible.

Forms, javascripts and active components don't need to function at this point,
but feel free to work on getting them working if you like.

6) obtain and save a New York Times Article API key from:
http://developer.nytimes.com/

Only the Article key is needed (there are MANY)

We will be building a NYT search engine on Monday.
