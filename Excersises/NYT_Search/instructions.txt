For those who cannot make it or are attending class remotely on Monday 

These steps will get you started, I will be adding to them before Monday.

Building NYT Article Search App:

1) Build a new application in an available folder.
		>rails new nyt

2) Add in a root route to article#search
		root :to => "article#search"

3) Delete public/index.html

NOTE: No Scaffolding!!

4) Build an Article model and controller, remember:

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
end

and 

class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
end

5) Make a search method in each of them

6) copy the Model code given in github (article.rb) and put in your NYT API key

7) Make a search view, add in some html

8) start your server and make sure the root route works and you see your view html
