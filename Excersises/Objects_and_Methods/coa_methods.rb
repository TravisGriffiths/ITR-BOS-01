# 1. Write a method which accepts a province code and returns the province name. Ask the user to input a code
# then display the result of passing the input to your method. If the hash does not include the province code
# they provide, let the user know their input is invalid. Challenges in this exercise include: how to access 
# the provinces hash from within your method, and how to return the hash key (province name) by using its 
# value (province code). You may want to explore built-in Hash class methods including .has_value? .invert and .fetch.

# that arrays begin with zero, not one.
