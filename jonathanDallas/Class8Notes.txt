Building test site

rails generate scaffold ... --no-stylesheets

rake routes

routes.rb
root :to => 'books#landing'

#used for link_tos
:as => 'search' 


add def landing to book controller

add new landing.html.erb to views/books

Way to see params passed in URL
<%= params %>

--

layouts under views

looks for the application.css file in app/assests directory
<%= stylesheet_link_tag    "application", :media => "all" %>

looks for the application.js file in app/assests directory
<%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>

adding new file that matches the controller will use that layout instead.

or

adding "layout 'application'" to your controller will use that one instead.

or
"layout :find_layout" looks to a method to get a value (usually a private method)
Good for logged in verses logged out.

or

use render within a method (render :layout => 'books')
