attr_reader and attr_writer instead of attr_accessor

Comments for functions 
what is function expecting and what should it return


for arrays don't use a[20] use a.fetch(20) => example a 10 array (nil, verses error).
Let things explode instead of getting "nil" back.  Or check for "nil"

$ on a variable means global.

$LOAD_PATH.unshift(".") => adds current path to the beginning of the Path array => use in IRB


require "Laptop" => looks for the Laptop.rb file in one of the LOAD_PATH locations

external files must be fully encapsulated in Classes.

not relative to the file call it. 
Example => "./lib/Person" works if you're running ruby in the current directory (not always the case).

--

"yield" is the block that is passed to the method
For Example => each is a method that accepts a block

inheritance 

Class Horse < Mammal
(can only be one level deep)

--

Class Variables

Class Horse
@@class var


Horse1.new
Horse2.new

both use the same the @@class var.
