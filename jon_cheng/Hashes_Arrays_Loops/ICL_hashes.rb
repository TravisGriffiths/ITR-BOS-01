# 1. Continuing with our Magic 8-Ball, let's switch it up a bit. If you
#    are not aware of what a Magic 8-Ball is:
#    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball
#
#    A Magic 8-Ball includes 20 answers, which can be construed as being
#    "positive", "negative" or "neutral".
#
#    Create a Hash called `responses` that has the key :positive that
#    includes all of the positive answers from the Wikipedia page as an
#    Array.
#
#    Print the Array to the screen.
#


# 2. Now that you have created your basic Hash, go and add the negative
#    and neutral responses as well by creating new keys.



# 3. Finally, we can now play around with our Hash and Arrays to find
#    out some information about them.
#
#    Check to see if the Hash has the key `:positive`



# 4. Check to see if it has the key `:cruel`



# 5. Play around with more options by looking at the RubyDoc info:
#    http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html 

responses { :positive =>["It is certain", "It is decidely so", "Without a doubt", "Yes, definitely", "You may rely on it", "As I see it, yes", "Most likely", "Outlook good", "Yes", "Signs point to yes"], :neutral => ["Reply hazy, try again", "Ask again later", "Better not tell you now", "Cannot predict now", "Concentrate and ask again"], :negative =>["Don't count on it", "My reply is no", "My sources say no", "Outlooks not so good","Very doubtful"]}
