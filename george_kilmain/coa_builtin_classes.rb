#We are going to use the built in class 'File' to create a .txt file and add some text to it. 

# 1. Ask the user for a file name. Open or create a file by that name, 
# by adding file extension".txt" to the users input.
# Ask the user to write a sentence. Append that sentence to the file, preceded
# by the current date and time. Use newline character ("\n") as needed. Be sure to close the file. 
# Check your work on the file system.

print "Enter File Name: "

file_name = gets.chomp + ".txt"

file = File.new(file_name, 'w+')

puts "\nPlease write a sentence: "

input_string = gets.chomp

file.write("#{Time.new.localtime}: #{input_string}")

file.close()



# 2. Use the File class to open the file created above (using the same input from above), to read and 
# display its contents to the terminal window. Read documentation on the .gets method, and write the 
# necessary loop code.

file = File.new(file_name, "r")

while(line = file.gets)
	puts line
end
